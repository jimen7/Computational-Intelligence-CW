# Computational-Intelligence-CW

This project is based around a simple game, where the goal is to land a ship safely from a randomized position. 

An evolutionaryt algorithm was developed to do that, whith four inputs: Up, Left, Right, Remaining fuel.

The constarints was that the algorithm can only run up t 20,000 times and produce the best possible results.
