We want ton replace the old population, so:

1) set new variable  population to be Get Good 50% of current population(Vaiable newPOP)		(50% of old population)

1) we reproduce  newPOP, therefore we get 50% new ch

2) We mutate existing new population

3) Evaluate

5) Add the children from above							(75% of popluation)






























6) do tournamentSelect to select best of these to slect parentrs

7) reproduce until; we reach correct number of population				(100% of population)

8) replace old population with new population



1)We have 200 parents. We set newPop to be 50% goo part of the 200  	(newPop = 100)

2) reproduce using newPop						



Examples to undesratnd

200 total initial population
get 50%
